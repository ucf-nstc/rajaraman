Install docker, then run `docker-compose up` to spin up the apache-php development environment. The dev site will be available at localhost:8080

Navigate to the themes/default directory and rum `npm install` to install dev deps, then run `gulp watch` to watch changes made to Scss stylesheets (make sure gulp is installed globally, `sudo npm install -g gulp`)

Have fun
