## Introduction
The natural applicability of micro and nano-scale technologies in life sciences opens new avenues for powerful interdisciplinary collaboration between scientists, engineers and medical professionals. The goal of our research group is the development of new micro/nanofabrication technologies and associated packaging technologies to address applications that advance the state of the art in human health. We will develop both traditional (silicon and glass based) and non-traditional (Polymers, Metal, Paper, Biomaterials etc.) micro/nanofabrication methodologies and focus on the applications of these technologies in cell-based assays outside the body, wearable & flexible sensors and implantable devices. Our focus will be on the non-traditional and bio-friendly fabrication methodologies but based on a particular project we will choose the best technique that addresses a particular application. 

Collaborators are sought specifically in the areas of biotechnology, toxicology, pharmacology, microfluidics, genomics, proteomics, diagnostics, therapeutics and medical devices that can advance the goals of the group and guide the applications of the platform technologies that our group will develop.
