### Micro/Nanofluidic Sensors and Systems for Lab & Organ-on-a-Chip System Applications:

Traditional MEMS technologies and sensing methodologies are now routinely used in modern industrial applications in consumer electronics, automobiles, telecommunications and healthcare. Researchers have started looking at micro/nanofabrication on several non-traditional substrates for cost-effectiveness, familiarity for end-users, ease of use and bench top fabrication/packaging (as opposed to cleanroom-based technologies). Our research group works on the development of paper/plastics microfluidics with integrated on-chip or off-chip optics for label-free biological sensing.
