### Micro/NanoElectrode Arrays and Biosensors: 

The development of in vivo or implantable micro/nano devices opens up several application areas in diagnostic, therapeutic and implantable monitoring of various functions of the human body as well as understanding basic cellular function. We are interested in developing new technologies for the development of Micro/NanoElectrode Arrays and affiliated biosensors for cellular sensing and other in-vivo and implantable applications.
