## Welcome.

Thanks for your interest in the research of the NanoBioSensors and Systems Group at the University of Central Florida. Our group is dedicated to the advancement of the state of the art in biological micro/nanofabrication technologies. Our goal is to utilize our knowledge and expertise in micro/nanofabrication technologies and apply these techniques to develop devices for the advancement of human health and personalized medicine. We develop non-traditional (Polymer, Metal, Paper, Biomaterials etc.) micro/nanofabrication methods and platform technologies as well silicon and glass based traditional technologies. Research into packaging methodologies is complimentary to research into biological micro/nanofabrication and we work on novel packaging methodologies for the assembly of our biological devices. 

We have developed and continue to strive to develop applications of biological micro/nanofabrication technologies in areas such as in vitro, wearable and implantable Microelectrode Arrays (MEAs), microneedles and other drug delivery devices, Lab & Organ on a Chip Devices, Microfluidics, flexible electronics devices and advanced materials. We also seek collaborators that will join us in advancing the applications of the devices and systems we create in the group and/or help us in defining new devices & systems that can be created.
