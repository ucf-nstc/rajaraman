***Affiliations:*** Chemistry Department and NanoScience Technology Center

***Degrees:*** B.S. in Chemistry and Biology, April 2016
Work in Lab: I am currently working on fabricating MEA devices to be used as electrogenic cell signal detectors

***Interest:*** I am interested in this field because it is interdisciplinary in that it combines chemical and biomedical sciences with engineering. As a chemistry (materials concentration) student, what interests me the most is the interaction between cells and different materials used in the fabrication of devices. I am interested in determining what materials work best for certain bioapplications, why these materials work well, and how to optimize the parameters.

***Post-doctoral plans:*** I hope to go into industry and work in research and development for a company that aims to advance the health care field.
