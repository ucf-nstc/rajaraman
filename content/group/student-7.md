**Academics**: Applied Life Sciences (Bachelor of Science) Undergraduate Student, Hochschule Kaiserslautern (Zweibrucken, Germany); Visiting Student to UCF; graduating in Spring 2018

***Interests***: Nanoscience is interesting because you work with materials of a very small scale but the results can also be applied in bigger scales. Another point is that physics, chemistry and biology can be easily combined with technology. Therefore, I chose the NSTC to do my bachelor’s thesis here.

***About***: I want to pursue a master’s degree in the field of nanoscience.
