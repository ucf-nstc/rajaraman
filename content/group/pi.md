Swaminathan Rajaraman (Swami) received his B.S. degree in Electronics Engineering from Bharathidasan University (Trichy, India), his M.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of Cincinnati (Cincinnati, OH) and his Ph.D. degree in Electrical Engineering from the Georgia Institute of Technology (Atlanta, GA) in 1998, 2001 and 2009 respectively. His Ph.D. advisor was Prof. Mark G. Allen, a renowned MEMS expert and Regents’ Professor at Georgia Tech (and now at the University of Pennsylvania). 

Swami returned to academia in August 2016, accepting a joint faculty position with the NanoScience Technology Center (NSTC) and Bridging the Innovation Development Gap (BRIDG) at the University of Central Florida (Orlando, FL) after spending more than 10 years in the MEMS/Microfabrication/Sensors industry. From 2001-2002 he was with Analog Devices Micromachined Products Division (MPD) in Cambridge, MA where he developed optical MEMS micro-mirrors for telecommunication applications. From 2004-2005 he was with CardioMEMS (acquired by St. Jude Medical which was acquired by Abbott Labs) in Atlanta, GA where he developed implantable MEMS pressure sensors for detection of heart disease. The CardioMEMS sensor is the only FDA-approved sensor for congestive heart failure detection in the market currently. In 2007 he co-founded Axion BioSystems Inc. (Atlanta, GA), a biotechnology company that has developed the industry’s first in-vitro Microelectrode Array (MEA) system. From 2007 to 2015, he served as the VP for Biological & Materials Engineering at Axion. Additionally, he has developed new projects for the MEMS foundry, MEMSCAP Inc.

His current research interests include in-vitro and in-vivo Micro/Nanoelectrode Arrays, micro/nanofabrication, micro/nanofabrication on novel, biological substrates, microneedles, flexible electronics devices, Micro/Nano Manipulation, micro-TAS/Lab & Organ-on-a-Chip devices, nanosensors and implantable MEMS devices.
 
Dr. Rajaraman was the track chair for a session on Bioelectric Sensors in IEEE EMBC 2010 and a chair for a session on MEMS Applications in Life Sciences at Georgia Bio’s annual meeting in 2013. He has additionally served on the Technical Program Committee of the Solid State Sensors, Actuators and Microsystems Workshop (Hilton Head 2014 and 2016). He has published in excess of 40 peer reviewed journal and conference papers and abstracts in the Micro/Nanofabrication, Biomedical Engineering and MEMS devices. He additionally holds 13 patents/applications.
